Magic Budget
This app has been a passion project of mine over the past couple years. Magic Budget is a Disney Parks budget planning app. Me and my husband absolutely love going to the parks but we always find ourselves coming over budget (too many churros). I built this app to help solve this problem! I found the estimated price for many of the popular items in the parks so users can quickly budget for what they might buy on their trip.

SafePeople
📲 Available on the App Store
Safe People was an idea my sister came up with and I had the honor of bringing to life. The purpose of the app is to help those struggling with addiction, anxiety, depression, etc.. reach out to their Safe People in times of need. When "triggered" the user can open the app and simply press the 'Safe Button'. This will prepare a pre-written customizable message that will be ready to send to their trusted people. The message and their trusted contacts will auto-populate in their iPhone's message app, and all they have to do is press "send".


Here's a sneak peek at the next update currently in the works!

Steps is a step counting app built with SwiftUI and utilizing HealthKit. This was a fun app to build! The home screen has a fun visual of how close the user is to their goal. The detail screen is built with a custom circle graph and a Swift Charts bar chart to show the user their weekly steps. The Awards tab encourages the user to keep taking steps to unlock awards each week. The Settings tab gives the user the option to change their daily steps goal and to enable or disable notifications. Check out more details in this repo at the link above!

Chord Trainer
This is an app I built for a freelance client. This client wanted the core of an app that they could eventually expand on with their own design. Chord Trainer is a flashcard game that helps piano students practice chords. Students can choose their game settings on the home screen (adjust how fast the flash cards will change, as well as choose the duration of the game). Once the game begins, the piano chords will filter through in a random order and without repeating until the student has practiced all the chords. This was a fun app to build since I also play piano! It was also a nice challenge of working with Timers. Most of all, it was an incredible experience to get to work with a client and bring their idea to life!
